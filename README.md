# WhiteWolfHackathon
Application created during the 24h hackathon 29/02/2020 - 1/03/2020.

# Idea
The idea was born when we thought about the problem of psychological help for young people. 
Teens are often ashamed of their problems and they don't know where to look for help.


We tried to create a platform for anonymous chat with specialists. 
You dont have to crate usser account, only what you need to continue conversasion with you psychologist is auto generate conversation code.
